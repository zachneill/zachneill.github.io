    <p>I'm a can-do full stack software developer. I specialize in answering the question,
      "Why do we never have time to do it right, but always have time to do it over?"

      I can do this with both the front end and back end. I'm most comfortable with Angular and Flask/Python. Java too,
      but I want it to be eaten by Kotlin.

      I got a full ride to Berea College from 2019-2023, graduating with Cum Laude in both Computer Science and Digital Media.
      I have a (Math.round(gpa * 100) / 100).toFixed(2) GPA of 4.0. I have a lengthy CS coursework as well.

      Classes include: Open-Source Software Engineering, Human Centered Computing, Data Structures, Database Systems, Software Design,
      Building Better Apps, Programming Languages, Game Design, Autonomous Robotics, and Networking.

      I was the first student to minor in Digital Media in a Fall semester and the second student in college history
      to ever minor in Digital Media. The degree occasionally sounds fake, but it is not.
